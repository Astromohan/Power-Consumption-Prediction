# Power-Consumption-Prediction

<b>About the data:</b><br>
The project consists of energy consumption data obtained from openly available data from electric supplier, PJM Interconnection LLC.
The data is gathered from monitoring companies that are part of PJM Grid and consists of hourly energy consumption in Megawatts(MWs) from the year 2001 to 2018, covering the east region of the United States (Pennsylvania, Jersey and Maryland).

<b>Aim of the project:</b><br>
The aim of the project is to build a model to predict the power consumption, to achieve this objective there were two models used, the first being Regression modelling followed by a gradient boosting algorithm called XGBoost to arrive at our predictions 
The performance of each of the models was then compared and their results interpreted to come at a conclusion.
